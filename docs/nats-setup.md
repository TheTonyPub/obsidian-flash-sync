# NATS setup for flash-sync

This guide covers two supported paths:

- **Managed setup:** run `fos` on the target Debian 13, Ubuntu 24.04, or Ubuntu 26.04 amd64 server. It owns only the `flash-osidian-sync` paths and creates the service topology.
- **Manual setup:** operate an existing NATS and Caddy deployment yourself. Preserve the subject permissions below; `fos` does not adopt or modify a manual deployment.

Every vault needs one pre-created JetStream KV bucket and a distinct NATS username/password. The plugin derives its bucket as `OBS_<vaultId>_FILES`; for example, vault ID `VAULT_A` uses `OBS_VAULT_A_FILES`. Do not enter the full bucket name as the Vault ID.

## Managed setup with fos

Install `fos` from source using [the installation guide](fos-install.md), then follow [the usage guide](fos-usage.md) to run bootstrap and manage vaults.

First point a domain, such as `sync.example.com`, at the server's public IP address. Ensure TCP ports 80 and 443 can reach the server so Caddy can complete ACME HTTP-01 validation and renew certificates. The plugin endpoint must be a valid domain-based URL such as `wss://sync.example.com`; IP-only TLS endpoints are not supported.

Run `sudo fos plan` to inspect the selected native, Docker Compose, or Podman Compose layout, then run `sudo fos bootstrap --wss-endpoint wss://sync.example.com` and confirm the rendered plan. `fos` generates separate administrator and first-vault NATS credentials. It displays them only through the protected post-install handoff; record both securely. The administrator credential is required for later bucket and vault-user management. Give plugin users only their vault-specific credentials.

The explicit `--wss-endpoint` overrides the managed bootstrap endpoint. Without it, later interactive vault-user operations use the managed endpoint or prompt; unattended operations fail before changing NATS if no endpoint is available. `--keep` retains only a newly generated vault credential in the protected local store. Bootstrap separately retains the administrator credential. Use `fos import --vault-id VAULT_ID` only for a vault explicitly retained with `--keep`; it reads local state and never contacts NATS. Missing, revoked, or unretained credentials require a vault rotation.

For unattended operation, use a root-owned protected input file, pass `--approve`, and choose a root-only `--secrets-output` destination. Do not pass passwords as command-line flags or save generated secrets in a repository, shell history, or ordinary logs.

`fos` keeps NATS behind Caddy. The public endpoint is HTTPS/WSS only; the NATS WebSocket listener is private to the local host or Compose network. It does not publish NATS TCP port 4222 or a public monitoring route.

## Manual NATS setup

Enable JetStream with persistent file storage. Before connecting a plugin, an administrator creates each bucket with file storage, history 10, and replicas 1:

```sh
nats kv add OBS_VAULT_A_FILES --history 10 --replicas 1 --storage file
nats kv info OBS_VAULT_A_FILES
```

Use a separate administrator account for bucket creation and later management. Do not grant bucket-creation permission to normal vault users. A per-vault NATS user requires the following permissions; repeat the pattern with the second vault's bucket and stream name.

```hcl
jetstream { store_dir: "/path/to/persistent/nats-store" }
websocket {
  listen: "127.0.0.1:9222"
  no_tls: true
}
authorization {
  users: [
    {
      user: "vault-a", password: "<bcrypt-hash>"
      permissions: {
        publish: { allow: [
          "$KV.OBS_VAULT_A_FILES.>",
          "$JS.API.STREAM.INFO.KV_OBS_VAULT_A_FILES",
          "$JS.API.DIRECT.GET.KV_OBS_VAULT_A_FILES",
          "$JS.API.STREAM.MSG.GET.KV_OBS_VAULT_A_FILES",
          "$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.KV_OBS_VAULT_A_FILES.>",
          "$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.KV_OBS_VAULT_A_FILES.>",
          "$JS.API.CONSUMER.DELETE.KV_OBS_VAULT_A_FILES.>",
          "$JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.KV_OBS_VAULT_A_FILES.>"
        ] }
        subscribe: { allow: ["_INBOX.>", "$KV.OBS_VAULT_A_FILES.>"] }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Use strong unique source passwords, store only their bcrypt hashes in NATS configuration, and provide the source password to the matching vault user through a protected channel. File records use `$KV.<bucket>.f.<fileId>` and path ownership records use `$KV.<bucket>.p.<sha256>`. The bucket-scoped `$KV.OBS_VAULT_A_FILES.>` publish and subscribe permissions shown above include both prefixes. If you narrow these permissions to individual key prefixes, grant read/write access to both `$KV.OBS_VAULT_A_FILES.f.>` and `$KV.OBS_VAULT_A_FILES.p.>`; keep the JetStream API and `_INBOX.>` permissions because the KV client needs them for reads, watches, consumer management, and status.

Terminate TLS at Caddy and proxy only to the private NATS WebSocket listener:

```caddyfile
sync.example.com {
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:9222
}
```

Confirm the domain DNS record resolves to the server and that every device accepts Caddy's public certificate. Do not expose the unencrypted upstream listener to the Internet. [NATS WebSocket configuration](https://docs.nats.io/reference/config/websocket/), [NATS authentication](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro), and [Caddy automatic HTTPS](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https) cover the underlying services.

## Plugin configuration and optional S3

In **Settings → Community plugins → flash-sync**, enter the provisioned Vault ID, `wss://` endpoint, vault username, and vault password, or open the vault-only URI from `fos`. The plugin opens only `OBS_<vaultId>_FILES` and saves imported NATS passwords and optional S3 secrets in Obsidian SecretStorage rather than ordinary plugin settings.

The URI and QR contain a vault password. An empty optional phrase creates plaintext version 2; a phrase of at least eight characters creates encrypted version 1, which the plugin requests during import. Keep QR/link sharing private and the phrase separate. Administrator credentials must never be imported into Obsidian.

S3 is optional. Leave all S3 fields empty to synchronize Markdown and content that fits the inline limit through NATS only. In that mode, images and other larger files are not synchronized. To synchronize large files, provide all S3 settings: HTTPS endpoint, bucket, region, access key ID, and secret key.

Because the plugin currently sends S3 requests from Obsidian's browser context, the bucket must allow CORS for the Obsidian origin. In the provider's bucket CORS settings (for Timeweb Cloud, **S3 storage → bucket → Settings → CORS**), add a rule allowing origin `app://obsidian.md`, methods `PUT` and `GET`, and headers `*`. Preserve any existing CORS rules when updating the bucket configuration. See [Timeweb Cloud's CORS setup guide](https://timeweb.cloud/docs/s3-storage/supported-features/cors-setup) or the equivalent guide for your S3 provider.

Without this rule, the browser blocks S3 uploads or downloads during the CORS preflight. `no-cors` is not a workaround: it cannot be used for these signed `PUT` requests or expose the response the plugin needs. A future transport based on Obsidian's native request API could avoid bucket CORS, but requires a separate plugin code change and validation.

## Verification and safe recovery

Test a vault user's `put`, `get`, `watch`, `create`, `update`, and `status` operations only in that vault's bucket. Verify that the same user cannot access another vault's bucket and that invalid credentials are rejected. Check the plugin status after **Connect**; `SYNCED` indicates the initial reconciliation completed.

### Development reset and rebootstrap of a selected vault

Use this data-preserving procedure only for a development vault whose exact Vault ID and bucket you have selected. It clears the selected vault's remote KV contents and its plugin sync indexes so the plugin can rebuild file records (`f.`) and path ownership records (`p.`) together. The reset is unsafe if any device has unsynced changes or unresolved conflicts.

1. Record the exact Vault ID, derived bucket name (`OBS_<VaultID>_FILES`), and every device that syncs this vault. Export or back up the Markdown and attachment files from every device; retain those backups until rebootstrap is verified. Include conflict copies and any divergent local files.
2. On every device, connect to the selected vault and wait for status `SYNCED` after reconciliation. Verify that the pending outbox count is `0` and the unresolved conflict count is `0` on every device. If any device cannot be checked, is not reconciled, has a pending operation, or has an unresolved conflict, stop; resolve or separately preserve the affected content and repeat these checks before continuing.
3. Disconnect the plugin on every device so no client can write while the reset is in progress. With the NATS administrator account, clear only the selected bucket's KV data, preserving other vault buckets. Do not remove the NATS store, server, or shared service volumes.
4. On each device, close Obsidian and clear only that device's IndexedDB database for the selected vault. The database name is `flash-sync-<deviceId>-<VaultID>`; preserve the Markdown files and all other Obsidian/plugin data. Do not clear local sync state until steps 1–3 have passed on every device.
5. Reopen Obsidian and connect each device to the same Vault ID and NATS bucket. Let reconciliation finish; verify `SYNCED`, zero pending operations, zero unresolved conflicts, and the expected files. Keep the backups until every device passes these checks.

This reset is a development rollout procedure, not routine recovery. For an explicitly disposable test vault, deletion is a separate destructive option: select its exact Vault ID and bucket, then have the NATS administrator delete that entire vault bucket and its vault-specific user/credential. This discards its remote data and does not preserve or rebootstrap files; do not use it for a vault whose contents must be retained. Leave other vault buckets, users, and shared NATS data untouched.

Before adding another device, back up its vault. Review conflict copies instead of deleting them blindly. For recovery, preserve the JetStream store and Caddy certificate data, stop the affected `fos-*` service or Compose project, and inspect `fos status` plus the protected state manifest. Do not remove volumes or the NATS store as part of a retry. Rotate a compromised vault password with the administrator account, import the new handoff on each device, and verify the old credential no longer connects. Revocation removes that vault's retained handoff record after the server change; use rotation with `--keep` when a new recoverable handoff is needed.
